#  Blood Group Detection using Fingerprint Images

An AI-powered system that predicts a person's **blood group** using their **fingerprint image** through a deep learning model (EfficientNet), and provides **personalized health and nutrition recommendations** ‚Äî all wrapped inside a secure and user-friendly **Streamlit web application**.

---

##  Overview

This project aims to simplify and speed up the blood group identification process using biometric data. Traditional blood testing is invasive and time-consuming ‚Äî especially in emergencies. Our model leverages **fingerprint patterns** and a trained CNN model to detect the user's blood group instantly.

Built using:
- **TensorFlow/Keras (EfficientNet)**
- **Streamlit** for interface
- **OpenCV/PIL** for image handling
- **Secure login/register system** using `Streamlit session_state` and JSON-based auth

---

## Key Features

-  Predicts blood group from fingerprint image  
-  Personalized health suggestions based on blood type  
-  Clean UI built using Streamlit  
-  Login & Register system for user access control  
-  Works locally in the browser via `localhost`  
-  Fully modular backend for easy scaling or deployment  
-  Fast inference with EfficientNet for mobile-ready model architecture

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blood-group-fingerprint.git
cd blood-group-fingerprint
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. **Install Required Packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If any error occurs, install manually:
```bash
pip install streamlit tensorflow-cpu==2.10 numpy==1.23.5 protobuf==3.20.3 pillow opencv-python
```

4. **Run the App**

##  Blood Group Recommendations

Each predicted blood group will return:
- Suggested Fruits
- Recommended Vegetables
- Ideal Exercises

Example for `O+`:
- Fruits: Mango, Bananas
- Vegetables: Broccoli, Peppers
- Exercise: Running, Weightlifting

---

## Future Scope

- Deploy to **Streamlit Cloud** or **Heroku**
- Convert to `.exe` for offline use
- Add PDF download of result
- Add database for user history
- Extend to real-time fingerprint scanning
