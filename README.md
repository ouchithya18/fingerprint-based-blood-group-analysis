# fingerprint-based-blood-group-analysis
This project introduces a deep learning-based system that detects a person's blood group from a fingerprint image using a non-invasive approach. It employs advanced image processing and neural networks to ensure accurate classification. Based on the detected blood group, the system also provides personalized health and nutrient recommendations. The entire solution is delivered through a user-friendly Streamlit web interface, making it simple and accessible for users.
